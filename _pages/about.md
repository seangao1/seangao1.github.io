This is Sean Gao. I'm currently a senior analyst at Deloitte. My research vision is to bridge the gap between theoreties and applications in deep learning, specifically interested in building efficient/robust/generalized deep learning algorithms to be applied in multiple fields such as NLP and medical imaging. Overall, my research interests lie in the intersection of :

1. Machine Learning Theory
2. Deep Learning Algorithm
3. Natural Language Processing

### Projects

[Small Language Model Project](https://github.com/seangao1/SG-GPT-SLM)

- Built a character-level multi-head transformer-based language model from scratch, featuring 25.28M parameters
- Embedding dimension: 512; Number of heads: 8; Head size: 64; Number of hidden layers: 8
- Designed to autocomplete text given a prompt
- Stack: **PyTorch, Neural Network, Object-Oriented Programming, Natural Language Processing.**


[Stock price forecasting with LSTM model](https://github.com/seangao1/LSTM-stock-price-forecast/blob/master/S_Gao_ML_Project_Stocks_with_LSTM_model.ipynb)

- Developing a framework for training a LSTM model to predict the closing stock price for IBM based on a variety of macro and micro economic factors, including GDP, various commodity prices, and indexes like NASDAQ and S&P500
- Adopting statistical metrics to assess the performance of the models and selected a champion model
- See [here](https://github.com/seangao1/LSTM-stock-price-forecast/blob/master/Predicting%20Stock%20Prices%20ML%20Project.pdf) for project report.
