This is Sean Gao. I'm currently a senior analyst at Deloitte. My research vision is to bridge the gap between theoreties and applications in deep learning, specifically interested in building efficient/robust/generalized deep learning algorithms to be applied in multiple fields such as NLP and medical imaging. Overall, my research interests lie in the intersection of :

1. Machine Learning Theory
2. Deep Learning Algorithm
3. Natural Language Processing
